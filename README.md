# Fast Deploy Microsoft Teams for Education

This solution is designed to help small schools, co-ops, and tutors quickly get up and running using Microsoft Teams. If you are a large school with your own IT staff, you are welcome to use this as well, but the official [School Data Sync](https://sds.microsoft.com/) from Microsoft might be a better option for you. 

This solution will help you creating logins and emails for all students and teachers, create a Teams site for each class, and assigning the teacher and students to the correct classes.

We realize that not everyone who is in need of the solution, is a technology guru. So, we have tried to make it as simple as possible to implement this for your school. If you have any questions or issues with this solution, please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [@mdowst](https://twitter.com/MDowst).

# Making Changes
This solution is designed to be run multiple times. If you have additional teachers, students, or classes to add, simply add them to the **Fast Deploy Microsoft Teams for Education.xlsx** workbook and run the **Start-Upload.bat** again. As long as the Teacher # and Student # do not change no user will be duplicated. This solution also only adds, it will never remove or change an existing user or Team site.  

# FAQ and Known Issues
## Students are unable to access Teams
**Issue/Question:** Some students may see a message that says, "You're missing out!" or "Ask your admin to enable Microsoft Teams for..."

**Resolution:** Be sure to Enable Microsoft Teams for your school. In EDU tenants, Teams isn't enabled by default; you'll have to turn it on first. Follow the link below for direction on how to enable Teams.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/education/intune-edu-trial/enable-microsoft-teams


## Teams and video focus
**Issue/Question:** Teams is currently limited to only 4 videos at a time and cannot go beyond that. This is difficult when teach a class because the instructor canâ€™t watch all students such as when they are taking a test or during class to see if they are paying attention. 

**Workaround:** For now, the best option appears to be to pin a video for the specific students you want to keep an eye on. 
**Current state:** This is #1 on feedback request, especially for teachers, so Microsoft is aware of this and are working on a solution.
